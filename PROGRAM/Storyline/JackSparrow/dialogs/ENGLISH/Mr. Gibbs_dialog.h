"WAKE UP!!!",
"Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot!",
"Do you not know me, Mr. Gibbs?",
"! You should know not to wake a man when he's sleepin'. It's bad luck.",
"Fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink. The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition from the man who did the waking.",
"Aye, that'll about do it.",
"Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n?",
"I'm going after the #scursed_ship#.",
"What?!",
"I know where she's going to be, and I'm gonna take her.",
" it's a fools errand. You know better than me the tales of the #scursed_ship#.",
"That's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.",
"From what I hear tell of Captain Barbossa, he's not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one.",
"Well then I say it's a very good thing I'm not a fool then.",
"Prove me wrong. What makes you think Barbossa will give up his ship to you?",
"Let's just say it's a matter of leverage.",   // TALISMAN replaced - The kid going with me is the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.",
"Is he now! Leverage, says you. I think I feel a change in the wind, says I. I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you.",
"One can only hope.",
"Take what you can!",
"Give nothin' back!",
"Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them faithful hands before the mast. Every man worth his salt and crazy to boot.",
"Humm... They seem... pretty good.",
"You know, it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.",
"It'll be far worse not to have her. Don't waste more time, let's go to Isla de Muerte.",
"(Mr Gibbs is sleeping)",
"Nice to meet you again, ",
"Thanks, Gibbs. How did you get the #scursed_ship#?",
"I and a few sailors succeeded in escaping Barbossa and his men aboard a boat. After that, we sailed to #sisland_Cayman# for five days. There, I met a friend that agreed to take us to Isla de Muerte in order to get back the Interceptor. But she wasn't there. However, we arrived at Isla de Muerte the same night than The Dauntless. So, we took advantage of the fight between Barbossa's crew and the marines aboard The Dauntless to capture the #scursed_ship#.",
"So, you knew I went to #sRedmond# as prisoner.",
"Indeed, I secretly met Will Turner in #sRedmond# to prepare a plan for your escape a few days ago.",
"Excellent, Mr Gibbs. Now, let's leave this island. I want to sail the #scursed_ship# like the old days.",
"Any orders Captain Jack?",
"Mr. Gibbs, go ahead to the Tavern and have a drink. You've earned it. I will come and get you when I need you.",
"Make the ship ready for #sisland_Guadeloupe#, Mr. Gibbs. We'll see you on board shortly, or you can join us again when you're ready.",
"We made it, Captain. Now, will you be wanting us to wait for you here, or to come with you?",
"Probably better if you two stay with the ship. In fact, lay her offshore in the lee of the hills. That will be the safest place.",  // TALISMAN changed
"We'll be more likely to be attacked on land. Probably better if we stick together. We can cover each others backs that way.",
"What...? The kid?", // TALISMAN added -->
"That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His ONLY child, savvy?",
