"Normally, I should ask who you is, Captain ",
", but, as you see I am ahlready aware of dat.",
"Very impressive Ma'am. I salute you. And I won't ask how you know, I get the feeling that, that is one of the questions a wise one wouldn't ask. [THINKS: Especially as I remember seeing you with my father, and suspect that you remember seeing me too.]",
"Now be me turn to be impressed Captain ",
". You undah'stand dat wiesdom is de beginning of ahll kno'ledge.",
"Thank you Ma'am. I would be pleased to know your name. [THINKS: I'd better not let her know that I already know it.] ",
"Me name is Tia Dalma and we be now introduced. So, what brings you here fair Captain?",
"If you knew my name Tia Dalma, then I am sure you know why I'm here.",
"Oh yes Captain. I kno' why you is here, and I also kno' dat you, don't.",
"What! Of course I do! I'm here to pick up a cargo.",
"Is dat so Captain... and what would dat cargo be?",
"AH! now you got me. I admit I don't know what the cargo actually is. I was just ordered to pick it up.",
"Pwoor Captain, de cargo be 'dem' not 'it'. You have come to pick up slaves.",
"SLAVES! NO! I am not a slave trader. Never!",
"I kno' dat Captain, dat is why I be speaking to you.",
"I shall sail away immediately. I want nothing to do with slave trading.",
"No Captain. You must free the slaves.",
"How do I do that?",
"By killing de t'ree guards just aroound de cornah' from de beach. They be blocking my waye to de jail where de slaves are held,... and by the waye, ye crew maye not help you.",
"Why do I get the feeling that you could do that on your own, and that you don't need my help?",
"Wiesdom raise it's head again Captain. You is correct, I don't need ye help, but I do need you to prove ye werds by deeds.",
"Why is that?",
"Do de deed Captain, den return to me here and I give you de answah'.",

"You be successful Captain.",

", you confirmed ye charactah' to me and proved ye'self, so now I have somet'ing special dat you must buy from me, and I will ahlso give you new clowthes to suit your new sitooation.",
"I kill three men and you want to sell me something?",
"No Captain, dis is no ordinary sale. Give me 500 in gold so I can bribe de jailah' and get passage for de slaves away from here to safety, and you get dis compass, and de new clowthes.",
"A compass! I already have a compass.",
"Not ah compass like dis one. Dis compass will lead one to what him heart desire most. Follow it wit' care.",
"You mean like the Chest of Cortez?",
"If dat be what you desires de most, den yes.",
"Hmmm. That sounds as if you know something different. ",
"I do know Captain dat you cannot return to ye employah'.",
"Ah! Yes. That will be a problem. Well, I do have somewhere else to go.",
"Yes Captain, back to de lighthouse at #sisland_Oxbay#.",
"You know about that too? Alright, we will trade, here is my gold.",
"And here be ye compass and ye new clowthes. Ye futah' be very complex Captain, but you should go now. Othah' guards be coming.",
"Yes I should, but what about you? [THINKS: WHOA! How did she do that?]",
"Don't worrye about me Captain. I disappear before dey arrive. Till we meet ahgain.",
"You mean 'if' we meet again... Actually, no you don't, you already know that we WILL meet, don't you?",
"Not ah compass like dis one. You should get it back to ye employah' as soon as you can.",
"I can't go back to Beckett, not after this.",
"Aye, but Beckett is not ye employah' now, is he? You is working fo' de Brot'erhwood.",
"You know that too? Here take the money and give me the compass. You scare me you know.",
"You faieled most miserably Captain. You must return empty handed I'm afraied.",
"I can't do that, this is my first mission, he won't employ me and I shall loose everything.",
"I see ye dilemma Captain and I could help you but it come at ah fearfuhl price.",
"I don't care, what ever it costs I will agree too.",
"That sounds omminous. Perhaps I will go back and face the music after all. Goodbye.",
"Very well Captain, here be de compass and de clowthes you need.",
"Not like dis one you don't. And you have agreed to me terms, so de deahl is done. I will need ahll ye money Captain.",
"Well that's harsh, but I wouldn't call it fearful.",
"The gowld is only part of de transaction. You will realise de rest latah'. Goodbye Captain.",
"Ah! that does sound a bit fearful. I will leave while I can. Goodbye.",
"Leave dis man alowne, Davy Jones, take me in his place. I beg you!",
"...",
"What do you wants, captain?",
"Nothing at the moment.", 
"Davy Jones... Leave this man alowne, it is not him time to go to ye Lockah'!",
