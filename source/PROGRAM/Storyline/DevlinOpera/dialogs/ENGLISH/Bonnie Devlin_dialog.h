"This is all so exciting!",
"Oh! Is it?",
"Oh! ",
" I'm so pleased to meet you at last. Father told me so much about you. My big sister, here at last!",
"I'm pleased to meet you too, Bonnie. But what's this big sister bit? I thought we were twins?",
"We are, we are! But you were born a minute before me! So that makes you my big sister! Ha! Ha!",
"Ah! I see. I'm glad we got that sorted out. That then puts me in charge. Ha! Ha! So we have a treasure to find... Are you up for the adventure?",
"Oh! Yes. I've been waiting for days for you to get here. When do we leave and where are we going?",
"Well... it says on the map here we should sail to #sisland_Turks# Island and look for the pirate Short Jack Gold, and ask him if he knows anything about the dirty snow! That seems a bit odd.",
"It's code, it's code! It's got to be in code. It will work out when we get there you'll see.",
"I hope you're right, or we are going to look really stupid, going up to a pirate and asking him if about snow!",
"Don't worry so much, ",
"! It will all work out, it always does. When do we sail?",
"As soon as I've checked the stores and equipment we can be off. Once we are out of sight of land, we must remember to raise the pirate flag to be able to land at #sisland_Turks# Island.",
"See, See! I said it was code. Oh! This is getting more exciting by the minute! And we'll get to see Blaze!",
"Calm down, calm down! We haven't found him yet. [THINKS:] Little sisters!",
"Here we are - #sisland_Turks# Island! Boy, how exciting is that! I bet we can meet some real pirates here.",
"Yes, that's why we need to take care, Bonnie. I sent a crewmember ahead to find out where that Short Jack Gold is.",
"While we're waiting for him - Tell me how you ended up in the new world, Beatrice!",
"Well, that's quite a complicated story, Bonnie. But I will tell it. It started about a year ago, I was standing at the Bristol dock, when suddenly...",
"Oh Boy, that must be the pirate haven Short Jack Gold told us about. At least there's no snow...",
"We'll ask around if anyone has seen Blaze, but carefully.",
"Do you think that it's Blaze's ship, Beatrice?",
"It looks like a smuggler's boat... Let's row over and examine it.",
"It is a smuggler's boat! There's the cargo piled up: Barrels of rum! But seems like some of them have been opened... And not a soul on deck!",
"I have a feeling where this is going to lead. Follow me below deck, Bonnie! I think you might just meet our brother.",
"Hello Blaze, It's true! I'm your sister Bonnie! I'm happy to meet you, sorry you're not feeling well today!...",
"Don't encourage him, Bonnie...",
"...Beatrice and I were looking for you because of the treasure! We have one part of the map and like you to join our search!",
"...",
"That ran silky smooth! Our cargo hold is empty and our wallet full!",
"Exactly, and this means we can focus on what's really important: The treasure map! Blaze, hand over your piece of the map so we can put them together and see where the map leads us!",
