"HA-HA-HA!! Don't waste your time with him. That kid likes to bother people. I don't know you do I, is it your first visit to our fair town?",

"I'm Pierre Delacroix, farmer. I live outside town near #sPort au Prince#. Today, I came here to sell some vegetables. And you, what do you do?", 
"Sailor, or more precisely I was a captain of a merchant ship.",
"Very interesting. And you want to find work as a captain on this island.",
"Of course and above all I want to earn a lot of gold. In Europe, I've heard it's easy to get rich in these islands..",
"Indeed, but it's also easy to die. But, maybe I can help you to find a job.",
"How?",
"I know a merchant named Eugene Martin in the Buccaneer Camp. He's in the habit of buying my vegetables from time to time. He's got some small ships, maybe you could work for him as a Captain.",
"What luck! Where is this camp?",
"Go to the jungle and keep walking straight through and you'll find it. But be careful, he sells smuggled goods so it's a risky job.",
"Yes, but I should earn more where the risk is greater. Thanks for the advice, I'm on my way, right now. See you!",
