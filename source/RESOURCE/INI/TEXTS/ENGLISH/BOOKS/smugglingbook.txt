Dear reader, if you opened this book that means you are intrested in smuggling. In this book I will try to teach you some things about smuggling in the hope you learn from my mistakes and you won't have to endure the problems I had when I started smuggling.
As you probably have noticed already, the Caribbean can be a dangerous place and it is even more dangerous for people who break the law. However, you can still grow old doing this kind of work, or at least that is what I hope with you.

Now onto the important part, you don't like the trade embargo's which the countries issue over their islands and you want to provide the poor citizens of these islands with these goods for a reasonable price. Well dear reader, this is where smuggling comes in play best! Luckily for us, there are multiple nations controlling the Caribbean so the contraband goods are available on other islands and we don't have to get them all the way from Europe (as the smugglers of old had to do).

If you procured some of these goods, you should set sail to the island of your choice and head into the town. Smugglers are often hard to find, but in most cases they make sure there is an agent in the tavern of the town to work as a middle man. He will look like a rude person to you, but remember that he is sitting there risking his life. If one of the guards found out he was helping the smugglers, he would end up with a rope around his neck. So please try to keep your conversation with him short. He can get you into contact with the smugglers on the island and he will tell you where to meet them.

But now comes the tricky part, which is called the coastguard. You see my best reader, most nations don't like it if you smuggle to their island so they patrol the waters and land to catch you in the act. Luckly for us, often these patrol schedules are not completely filled and there are windows in the patrol schedule to make your deal without getting detected. But knowing when these windows occur is very hard. Often coastguard officers will have a book on them with the patrol schedule, but they are not going to give it to you. You could send out one of your officers to scout the place and report what time would be best. But this is of course risky. I often went to the local tavern and tried my luck on some guards which where enjoying their time off. With some coins or a well tought out lie, you can often get them to tell you what you need. Especially as they know what I had to find out the hard way. The patrol schedule on an island is only for a set time and when that time has passed, they will make a new schedule. They do this to make sure if their schedule was procured in some way, it becomes useless and they even hope someone will still use it so they will probalby catch them in the act then. This is what happened to me as well. Luckily I was able to flee just in time to save my life and that of my crew. And this is why I am now writing this book for you, dear readers, to know be aware of the pitfalls of smuggling.
