# New Horizons port to Maelstrom engine

Port of the amazing [New Horizons (NH)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/new-horizons) mod for Pirates of the Caribbean (PotC) to the awesome [Maelstrom](https://chezjfrey.itch.io/gentlemen-of-fortune-maelstrom-engine) engine.  

***This repository contains only the text files that make up the NH mod port to Maelstrom*** for the rest of the files, please download the main mod https://chezjfrey.itch.io/new-horizons


## New Horizons

The amazing New Horizons mod has been developed as a labor of love for more than a decade. It adds many beautiful ship models to PotC, quests, storylines, and more.  It doesn't require you to own the original game and can be downloaded here:  [New Horizons at ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/new-horizons).

## Maelstrom Engine

Unfortunately the old PotC engine has not aged well and requires effort to run in modern machines and OS. The maelstrom engine is a significantly improved engine that enables a host of improvements.   It can run mods from the different Akela games, including this port.

The Maelstrom engine can be purchased here:  [Itch.io Maelstrom engine store page](https://chezjfrey.itch.io/gentlemen-of-fortune-maelstrom-engine)

You can see more information about how to run ported Maelstrom mods in this [Maelstrom Engine installation guide - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvaHWHC4hQY)
